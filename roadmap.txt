Add verbose parameter to enable debugging

Write test-cases to assert some correctness

Variation of parameters used in functions
   discretization
   Ï‰

plot theoretical bounds

does cimg have to grayscale..?  
cimg has path stuff

make program user friendly!
    output what is going on
    estimate a total loading time betterly

fix division by pixel size 
    not so easy to say how..

run on all images with iterative

gnuplot from c++, not bash
    havily relies on boost

timing different functions / iterations

code refactoring

implement FFT

I have several cases where I accumulate results in vectors, 
and then re-iterate over the vector to do my operations.
Maybe it's clean, but it adds constants to linear execution

multi-threaded, to be faster per image
   red black
   multitraad

Detection of convergence, etc

       [described in the middle of the page]

Other optimizations?
    hvordan ser en matrise ut mot slutten? kan noen deler kuttes ut?

My translation to vector takes about 0.1 seconds for each image - maybe there is
    better way

# Gong ville gjoore dette 
((adding some of the more advanced))
