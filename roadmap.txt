# Specified in order of priority

plots should be generated with a flag specification
    FOR NOW, JUST SYSTEM(plot.sh)

implement FFT
    make sure FFT-lib does not have any plotting, otherwise replace gnuplot

fix division by pixel size

plots should have average AND all the others
    ish done

gnuplot from c++, not bash
    havily relies on boost

 compute line on I and U
    so it is easier to analytically get the solution.

the output, data-folder should not be in project dir, rather in pwd() from
    where you are
        all saves and everything should be rendered through classes such that it
            is easy to get the right path for all.

 Make the graphs loggy
    easier to see what's going on 


 render two images, show plot for these two.

 multi-threaded, to be faster per image
    red black
    multitraad

 timing different functions / iterations

 make histograms

 code refactoring

 Variation of parameters used in functions
    discretization
    Ï‰

 Detection of convergence, etc

 Other optimizations?
    hvordan ser en matrise ut mot slutten? kan noen deler kuttes ut?

My translation to vector takes about 10 seconds

# Gong ville gjoore dette 
((adding some of the more advanced))
