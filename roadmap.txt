 compute images on a grayscale in progress

 fix division by pixel size

 plots should have average AND all the others
    ish done

 compute line on I and U
    so it is easier to analytically get the solution.

 Make the graphs loggy
    easier to see what's going on 


 render two images, show plot for these two.

 multi-threaded, to be faster per image
    red black
    multitraad

 timing different functions / iterations

 make histograms

 code refactoring

 Variation of parameters used in functions
    discretization
    Ï‰

 Detection of convergence, etc

        [described in the moddile of the page]

 Other optimizations?
    hvordan ser en matrise ut mot slutten? kan noen deler kuttes ut?


# Gong ville gjoore dette 
((adding some of the more advanced))
