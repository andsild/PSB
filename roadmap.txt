# Specified in order of priority, i.e. top item is done first, last item last

fix division by pixel size

plots should have average AND all the others
    ish done

plot theoretical bounds

make program user friendly!
    output what is going on
    estimate a total loading time betterly

run on all images with iterative

gnuplot from c++, not bash
    havily relies on boost

 compute line on I and U
    so it is easier to analytically get the solution.

 Make the graphs loggy
    easier to see what's going on 


 render two images, show plot for these two.



 timing different functions / iterations

 make histograms

 code refactoring

 implement FFT

 Variation of parameters used in functions
    discretization
    Ï‰


 multi-threaded, to be faster per image
    red black
    multitraad


 Detection of convergence, etc

        [described in the moddile of the page]

 Other optimizations?
    hvordan ser en matrise ut mot slutten? kan noen deler kuttes ut?

My translation to vector takes about 0.1 seconds for each image - maybe there is
    better way

# Gong ville gjoore dette 
((adding some of the more advanced))
