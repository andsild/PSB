Resolvers
    plot the resolved image

FFT

Wavelet

Change from double to float?

timing different functions / iterations

Change from unistd to cimg_option

Write test-cases to assert some correctness

Variation of parameters used in functions
   discretization
   Ï‰

plot theoretical bounds

make program user friendly!
    output what is going on
    estimate a total loading time betterly

fix division by pixel size 
    not so easy to say how..

run on all images with iterative

gnuplot from c++, not bash
    heavily relies on boost

code refactoring

implement FFT

multi-threaded, to be faster per image
   red black
   multitraad

Detection of convergence, etc

       [described in the middle of the page]

Other optimizations?
    hvordan ser en matrise ut mot slutten? kan noen deler kuttes ut?

# Gong ville gjoore dette 
((adding some of the more advanced))
