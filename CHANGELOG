Changed from CImg<T> to vector<T>. The translation from CImg to vector
takes some time, but it is much faster to iterate over a 1d vector.
This NEEDS to be TESTED later

Changed from declarative style to OOP, which makes it easier to develop the 
program.

Changed from difference with averages of absolute differences
in U_{k} and U_{k+1}, to getting the max of absolute differences.

Realized that I was confusing stopping criteria with relative differences

Changed from 1d std::vector to Cimg macro-loops, which was much faster

changed from abs to fabs - big difference...........

Change SOR to red-black - it now doesn't converge, and gives good results
Unlike gauss-seidel and jacobi, which in general needs stop-critera set to 
a factor of 100 less than SOR to give accurate results, much slower!
