try out cimg plots instead of gnuplot

change from file.hpp to cimg class based
    remove mkdirp?

image display should become a complete stand-alone

fix the conversions from string and so on, srlsy..

there should be one logger instance line for CLog and LOG

fix so that there is debug and then <image_output>

Create a master class "solver"
    subclasses can process differently
    takes as parameter a function and an image_fmt

Change from reading folder to file

generalize the display functions

try to get rid of "file.hpp" and replace with cimg equivalents
