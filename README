### INTRODUCTION

What methods will reduce errors most effectively when iterating over
images?

The program is written in C++ for speed, however, concepts like threading
and multigrids are currently avoided for ease of coding.

### EDITIONS

"PSB" is a work in progress, so the structure of the code is changed from
time to time. Do frequent "git pull" if you intend to use it.

#### PSB

* LIST FEATURES HERE
* PSB keeps it simple, so **you** can modify the code to your needs.

#### CImg

* Open-source
* Minimalistic, only include "CImg.h"
* Lot of features

See http://cimg.sourceforge.net/

### Gnuplot
* Open-source
* Simple
* Can be operated from the command line and through open-source interfaces in
  C++

See http://www.gnuplot.info/

### bitmap
* Open-source
* Easily create images to edit


### CONFIGURATION / CONTROL:

PSB is written to be operated from the command line. 
It will per default write to "./output" in the ${PWD} from which it is invoked.

### COMMAND SYNTAX

Please refer to the manpage in our "doc" folder, by "man -l PSB.1"

* <Arrow UP> : next image
* <Arrow DOWN> : previous image
* <Arrow LEFT> : next solver (if any)
* <Arrow RIGHT> : previous solver (if any)

### VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

#### Variables

#### Constants (not dumpable or writeable)
TODO

### Plot.sh

The script that does the plotting (can also be invoked from the PSB-source code)

It is currently a series of for-loops with UNIX's "find" 

### COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

Please refer to the manpage in our "doc" folder, by "man -l PSB.1"

### BUGS

Please report new issues to the github mainpage or the developer @ andsild@gmail.com
